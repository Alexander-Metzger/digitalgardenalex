# Pathway Glossary

## Neurotransmitter–DA/NE  
Catecholamine signaling. DA/NE bind GPCRs (D1–D5, α/β-adrenergic) → ↑ cAMP/PKA, Ca²⁺ influx. ↑ arousal, motivation, locomotion.

## Neurotransmitter–ACh  
ACh acts via nicotinic ion channels (fast depolarization) and muscarinic GPCRs (M1–M5). Supports learning, memory, neuromuscular drive.

## CNS–Stimulant  
Blockade of monoamine reuptake transporters → ↑ extracellular DA/NE in cortex/striatum → ↑ wakefulness, psychomotor drive.

## ATP–PCr System  
Creatine kinase transfers phosphate from PCr → ADP. Rapid ATP regeneration during short maximal effort (<10s).

## Ca²⁺–Signaling  
Ca²⁺ enters via L-type VGCCs and released from SR (RyR). Triggers contraction, calmodulin, CaMK, and mitochondrial enzymes.

## Osmolyte–Cell Volume  
Small molecules (creatine, taurine, betaine) regulate osmotic stress, stabilize proteins, modulate mTOR and apoptosis.

## Methylation–Homocysteine  
Betaine donates methyl via BHMT → homocysteine → methionine → SAM. Supports DNA/protein methylation, lowers vascular risk.

## IGF1–mTOR Axis  
IGF-1 activates PI3K–Akt → mTORC1 → phosphorylation of p70S6K/4EBP1 → ↑ translation, hypertrophy.

## Vitamin–Hormone Signaling  
Vitamin D binds VDR (nuclear receptor) → ↑ Ca²⁺ channels/transporters. Vitamin K2 carboxylates osteocalcin/MGP → bone mineralization.

## Bone–Mineralization  
Osteoblasts secrete osteocalcin, ALP. Hydroxyapatite crystal deposition requires Ca²⁺, phosphate, vitamin D/K synergy.

## NFkB–Inflammation  
TNFα/IL-1 activate IKK → NF-κB released from IκB → nuclear translocation → transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

## Membrane–Fluidity  
PUFAs (EPA/DHA) incorporate into phospholipid bilayers → ↑ receptor mobility, ↓ lipid raft rigidity → improved insulin/GPCR signaling.

## MPS–Sensitivity  
ω-3s and leucine ↑ mTOR responsiveness → reduced leucine threshold for muscle protein synthesis.

## NMDA–GABA Balance  
Mg²⁺ blocks NMDA at rest. Glycine/taurine = NMDA co-agonists + GABA-A agonists → adjust excitatory/inhibitory tone → anxiolysis, sleep.

## Sleep–Regulation  
Adenosine buildup, melatonin (MT1/MT2), and GABAergic tone regulate sleep onset, SWS, REM cycles.

## Thermoregulation  
Glycine modulates NMDA in preoptic hypothalamus → vasodilation, ↓ core temperature → sleep induction.

## ECM–Remodeling  
Fibroblasts remodel collagen/elastin via MMPs/TIMPs. Promoted by GH/IGF1, BPC-157, TB-500.

## Collagen–Crosslinking  
Vit C–dependent hydroxylases stabilize collagen triple helices → tendon/ligament resilience.

## Adenosine–Blockade  
Caffeine antagonizes A1/A2A adenosine receptors → ↑ DA/NE release, ↓ sleep pressure → ↑ alertness, performance.

## GABA–Agonism  
Taurine/glycine weakly activate GABA-A receptors → ↑ Cl⁻ influx → hyperpolarization → sedation, relaxation.

## Circadian–Rhythm  
Light input via retinal melanopsin → SCN activation → regulation of PER/CRY clock genes → synchronizes sleep–wake cycles.

## Antioxidant–Defense  
Melatonin, taurine, curcumin directly scavenge ROS + activate Nrf2 → ↑ SOD, catalase, glutathione.

## GH–IGF1 Axis  
GHRH → GH (pituitary) → IGF-1 (liver) → anabolic tissue effects, ECM repair. Pulsatile during sleep.

## LH–FSH Axis  
GnRH → pituitary LH/FSH → gonadal testosterone + spermatogenesis. Suppressed by estrogen feedback.

## Estrogen–ER Pathway  
Estrogens bind ERα/β (nuclear receptors) → gene transcription for reproduction, bone, metabolism. Blocked by SERMs → ↑ GnRH.

## p70S6K–mTOR  
Central growth regulator. mTORC1 activates p70S6K/4EBP1 → ↑ translation, hypertrophy. Sensitive to AA, IGF-1, ATP/AMP ratio.

## AMPK–Energy Sensing  
AMPK activated by ↑ AMP/ATP → ↑ GLUT4, FAO, autophagy. Inhibits mTOR. Master regulator of cellular energy.

## NO–Perfusion  
Arginine → NO (via eNOS) → cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation → vasodilation → ↑ perfusion, ↓ BP.

## Urea Cycle  
Ammonia detox: NH₃ + CO₂ → urea. Supported by arginine/citrulline → reduced fatigue, improved performance.

## Mitochondrial Efficiency  
Nitrates → NO → cytochrome c oxidase modulation → less O₂ cost per ATP produced.

## FAO–CPT1  
Carnitine shuttle via CPT1/2 imports FA into mitochondria → β-oxidation. ↑ endurance, fat use.

## Acyl–Carnitine Shuttle  
Carnitine binds long-chain FA → acyl-carnitine transported into mitochondria → re-converted → β-oxidation.

## Adrenergic–β  
β-AR (Gs GPCR) → ↑ cAMP → PKA → HSL/ATGL activation → lipolysis, ↑ HR, contractility.

## Adrenergic–α2  
α2-AR (Gi GPCR) presynaptic autoreceptor → ↓ NE release → suppresses lipolysis, sympathetic tone.

## Glutamate–GABA Balance  
Theanine antagonizes NMDA, ↑ GABA, balances excitatory glutamate → relaxation, anxiolysis.

## Androgen Receptor  
Ligand-activated nuclear receptor. Testosterone/SARMs → ↑ AR binding → hypertrophy, bone density ↑.

## Ubiquitin–Proteasome  
E3 ligases (atrogin-1, MuRF1) tag proteins → proteasomal degradation. HMB/IGF-1 inhibit → anti-catabolic.

## COX2–Eicosanoid  
COX2 converts AA → prostaglandins → inflammation, pain. Curcumin ↓ COX2 → anti-inflammatory.

## Angiogenesis  
VEGF/FGF → endothelial cell migration → new capillaries. BPC/TB-500 stimulate → healing ↑.

## Cell Migration  
Thymosin β4 regulates actin polymerization → ↑ cell motility, tissue regeneration.

## Immune–Antiviral  
Zn²⁺ inhibits viral RNA polymerase and modulates IFN response → ↓ viral replication.

## HPA–Cortisol  
Hypothalamic CRH → pituitary ACTH → adrenal cortisol. Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, peaking after waking, suppressed by darkness.

## Serotonin–5HT  
Tryptophan → serotonin via TPH. Acts on 5HT receptors (GPCRs/ion channels). Modulates mood, cognition, circadian entrainment.

## Melatonin–MT1/MT2  
Melatonin binds MT1/MT2 GPCRs in SCN → inhibits neuronal firing, shifts circadian phase, promotes sleep onset and maintenance.
