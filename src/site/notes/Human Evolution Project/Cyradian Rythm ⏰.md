| S.A.D Lamp | 20min        | >30min After Waking | [[#Circadian–Rhythm]] [[#HPA–Cortisol]] [[#Serotonin–5HT]] | Bright light → melanopsin → SCN activation → phase shift of circadian clock; ↑ serotonin synthesis; transient ↑ cortisol | Serotonergic tone ↑, Cortisol ↑, improved alertness & mood |
| Sleep Mask | During Night | Before Sleep        | [[#Circadian–Rhythm]] [[#Melatonin–MT1/MT2]]               | Darkness → SCN signals pineal gland → melatonin secretion ↑ via MT1/MT2 receptors                                        | Sleep quality ↑, circadian stability ↑                     |
