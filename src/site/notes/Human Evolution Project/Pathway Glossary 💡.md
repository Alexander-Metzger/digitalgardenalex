# Pathway Glossary

### Neurotransmitter-DA-NE

Catecholamine signaling. DA/NE bind GPCRs (D1–D5, α/β-adrenergic) → ↑ cAMP/PKA, Ca²⁺ influx. ↑ arousal, motivation, locomotion.

### Neurotransmitter-ACh

ACh acts via nicotinic ion channels (fast depolarization) and muscarinic GPCRs (M1–M5). Supports learning, memory, neuromuscular drive.

### CNS-Stimulant

Blockade of monoamine reuptake transporters → ↑ extracellular DA/NE in cortex/striatum → ↑ wakefulness, psychomotor drive.

### ATP-PCr-System

Creatine kinase transfers phosphate from PCr → ADP. Rapid ATP regeneration during short maximal effort (<10s).

### Ca-Signaling

Ca²⁺ enters via L-type VGCCs and is released from SR (RyR). Triggers contraction, calmodulin, CaMK, and mitochondrial enzymes.

### Osmolyte-Cell-Volume

Small molecules (creatine, taurine, betaine) regulate osmotic stress, stabilize proteins, modulate mTOR and apoptosis.

### Methylation-Homocysteine

Betaine donates methyl via BHMT → homocysteine → methionine → SAM. Supports DNA/protein methylation, lowers vascular risk.

### IGF1-mTOR-Axis

IGF-1 activates PI3K–Akt → mTORC1 → phosphorylation of p70S6K/4EBP1 → ↑ translation, hypertrophy.

### Vitamin-Hormone-Signaling

Vitamin D binds VDR (nuclear receptor) → ↑ Ca²⁺ transporters. Vitamin K2 carboxylates osteocalcin/MGP → bone mineralization.

### Bone-Mineralization

Osteoblasts secrete osteocalcin, ALP. Hydroxyapatite deposition requires Ca²⁺, phosphate, vitamin D/K synergy.

### NFkB-Inflammation

TNFα/IL-1 activate IKK → NF-κB released from IκB → nuclear translocation → transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

### Membrane-Fluidity

PUFAs (EPA/DHA) incorporate into membranes → ↑ receptor mobility, ↓ lipid raft rigidity → improved insulin/GPCR signaling.

### MPS-Sensitivity

ω-3s and leucine ↑ mTOR responsiveness → reduced leucine threshold for muscle protein synthesis.

### NMDA-GABA-Balance

Mg²⁺ blocks NMDA at rest. Glycine/taurine = NMDA co-agonists + GABA-A agonists → adjust excitatory/inhibitory tone → anxiolysis, sleep.

### Sleep-Regulation

Adenosine buildup, melatonin (MT1/MT2), and GABAergic tone regulate sleep onset, SWS, REM cycles.

### Thermoregulation

Glycine modulates NMDA in preoptic hypothalamus → vasodilation, ↓ core temperature → sleep induction.

### ECM-Remodeling

Fibroblasts remodel collagen/elastin via MMPs/TIMPs. Promoted by GH/IGF1, BPC-157, TB-500.

### Collagen-Crosslinking

Vit C–dependent hydroxylases stabilize collagen triple helices → tendon/ligament resilience.

### Adenosine-Blockade

Caffeine antagonizes A1/A2A adenosine receptors → ↑ DA/NE release, ↓ sleep pressure → ↑ alertness, performance.

### GABA-Agonism

Taurine/glycine weakly activate GABA-A receptors → ↑ Cl⁻ influx → hyperpolarization → sedation, relaxation.

### Circadian-Rhythm

Melatonin binds MT1/MT2 in SCN → resets clock genes (PER/CRY) → synchronizes circadian rhythm.

### Antioxidant-Defense

Melatonin, taurine, curcumin directly scavenge ROS + activate Nrf2 → ↑ SOD, catalase, glutathione.

### GH-IGF1-Axis

GHRH → GH (pituitary) → IGF-1 (liver) → anabolic tissue effects, ECM repair. Pulsatile during sleep.

### LH-FSH-Axis

GnRH → pituitary LH/FSH → gonadal testosterone + spermatogenesis. Suppressed by estrogen feedback.

### Estrogen-ER-Pathway

Estrogens bind ERα/β (nuclear receptors) → gene transcription for reproduction, bone, metabolism. Blocked by SERMs → ↑ GnRH.

### p70S6K-mTOR

mTORC1 activates p70S6K/4EBP1 → ↑ translation, hypertrophy. Sensitive to amino acids, IGF-1, ATP/AMP ratio.

### AMPK-Energy-Sensing

AMPK activated by ↑ AMP/ATP → ↑ GLUT4, FAO, autophagy. Inhibits mTOR. Master regulator of energy balance.

### NO-Perfusion

Arginine → NO (via eNOS) → cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation → vasodilation → ↑ perfusion, ↓ BP.

### Urea-Cycle

Ammonia detox: NH₃ + CO₂ → urea. Supported by arginine/citrulline → reduced fatigue, improved performance.

### Mitochondrial-Efficiency

Nitrates → NO → cytochrome c oxidase modulation → less O₂ cost per ATP produced.

### FAO-CPT1

Carnitine shuttle via CPT1/2 imports FA into mitochondria → β-oxidation. ↑ endurance, fat use.

### Acyl-Carnitine-Shuttle

Carnitine binds long-chain FA → acyl-carnitine transported into mitochondria → β-oxidation.

### Adrenergic-b

β-AR (Gs GPCR) → ↑ cAMP → PKA → HSL/ATGL activation → lipolysis, ↑ HR, contractility.

### Adrenergic-a2

α2-AR (Gi GPCR) presynaptic autoreceptor → ↓ NE release → suppresses lipolysis, sympathetic tone.

### Glutamate-GABA-Balance

Theanine antagonizes NMDA, ↑ GABA, balances excitatory glutamate → relaxation, anxiolysis.

### Androgen-Receptor

Ligand-activated nuclear receptor. Testosterone/SARMs → ↑ AR binding → hypertrophy, bone density ↑.

### Ubiquitin-Proteasome

E3 ligases (atrogin-1, MuRF1) tag proteins → proteasomal degradation. HMB/IGF-1 inhibit → anti-catabolic.

### COX2-Eicosanoid

COX2 converts AA → prostaglandins → inflammation, pain. Curcumin ↓ COX2 → anti-inflammatory.

### Angiogenesis

VEGF/FGF → endothelial cell migration → new capillaries. BPC/TB-500 stimulate → healing ↑.

### Cell-Migration

Thymosin β4 regulates actin polymerization → ↑ cell motility, tissue regeneration.

### Immune-Antiviral

Zn²⁺ inhibits viral RNA polymerase and modulates IFN response → ↓ viral replication.

### HPA-Cortisol-Axis

Hypothalamic CRH → pituitary ACTH → adrenal cortisol. Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, peaking after waking, suppressed by darkness.

### Serotonin-5HT

Tryptophan → serotonin via TPH. Acts on 5HT receptors (GPCRs/ion channels). Modulates mood, cognition, circadian entrainment.

### Melatonin-MT1-MT2

Melatonin binds MT1/MT2 GPCRs in SCN → inhibits neuronal firing, shifts circadian phase, promotes sleep onset and maintenance.

### PPARδ  
Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor delta (PPARδ) is a nuclear receptor highly expressed in skeletal muscle.  
Ligand binding (e.g., GW501516/Cardarine) → PPARδ–RXR complex → binds PPREs on DNA → ↑ transcription of genes for fatty acid transport (CPT1, FAT/CD36), mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative metabolism.  
**Outcome:** Enhanced endurance, ↑ fat oxidation, glycogen sparing.
